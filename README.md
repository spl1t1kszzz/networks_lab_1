# networks_lab_1
This program allows you to detect copies of yourself by exchanging multicast UDP messages in both IPv4 and IPv6 networks. The application is also able to track the moments of appearance and disappearance of other copies of itself. The program can work in two modes - 'send' or 'receive', that is, send packets or wait for them. To run the program in 'send' mode, then pass < send> + <multicast_address> as command line arguments or <receive> + <listen_address> + <multicast_address> to start 'receive' mode
